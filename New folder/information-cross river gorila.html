            <h2 class="category">Where it lives: </h2>
            <p class="paragraph">Cross River gorillas are scattered in at least 11 groups across the lowland montane forests and rainforests of Cameroon and Nigeria </p>

            <h2 class="category">It's natural habitat: </h2>
            <p class="paragraph">This gorilla species live in equatorial Africa, separated by about 560 miles of Congo Basin forest. </p>

            <h2 class="category">Role in ecosystem:</h2>
            <p class="paragraph">Orangutans help forest health by acting as the world's largest seed dispersers. They cover large areas as they forage for food, an additional risk in fragmented habitat. They spend most of their time in trees. That's where they thrive.</p>

            <h2 class="category">How can we help:</h2>
                <p class="paragraph"> Cross River gorillas are important seed dispersers </p>
               <p class="paragraph">playing a critical role in forest regeneration in their fragile ecosystem.</p>
                <p class="paragraph">Since they travel long distances, they disperse seeds far from the mother tree, adding to the diversity of the forest flora.</p>

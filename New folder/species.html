                Endangered species, any species that is at risk of extinction because of 
                a sudden rapid decrease in its population or a loss of its critical habitat.
                 Previously, any species of plant or animal that was threatened with extinction 
                 could be called an endangered species.

                 By the early 21st century it could be said that human beings (Homo sapiens) are the greatest

          <h2>African forest elephant</h2>
          <p>African forest elephants are the elusive cousin of the African savanna elephant. 
            They inhabit the dense rainforests of west and central Africa. 
            Their preference for dense forest habitat prohibits traditional counting methods such as
             visual identification. Their population is usually estimated through "dung counts"—an analysis on the 
             ground of the density and distribution of the feces..</p>

          <h2>Amur Leopard</h2>
          <p>People usually think of leopards in the savannas of Africa but in the Russian Far East, a rare subspecies has adapted to life in 
            the temperate forests that make up the northern-most part of the species’ range. 
            Similar to other leopards, the Amur leopard can run at speeds of up to 37 miles per hour. 
            This incredible animal has been reported to leap more than 19 feet horizontally and up to 10 feet vertically.</p>

          <h2>Black Rhino</h2>
          <p>Black rhinos are the smaller of the two African rhino species. The most notable 
            difference between white and black rhinos are their hooked upper lip. This distinguishes them from 
            the white rhino, which has a square lip. Black rhinos are browsers rather than grazers, and their pointed 
            lip helps them feed on leaves from bushes and trees. They have two horns, and occasionally a third, small 
            posterior horn.</p>

            <h2>Bornean orangutan</h2>
            <p>Bornean orangutan populations have declined by more than 50% over the past 60 years, 
                and the species' habitat has been reduced by at least 55% over the past 20 years.

                The Bornean orangutan differs in appearance from the Sumatran orangutan, with a 
                broader face and shorter beard and also slightly darker in color. Three subspecies
                 are recognized, each localized to different parts of the island</p>

            <h2>Cross River gorillas</h2>
            <p>This subspecies of the western gorilla is very similar in appearance to the more numerous western lowland gorilla, but subtle differences 
                can be found in the skull and tooth dimensions. Cross River gorillas live in a region 
                populated by many humans who have encroached upon the gorilla’s territory clearing forests for
                 timber and to create fields for agriculture and livestock. Poaching occurs in the forests as well,
                  and the loss of even a few of these gorillas has a detrimental effect on such a small population.</p>

            <h2>Hawksbill sea turtle</h2>
            <p>Hawksbills are named for their narrow, pointed  pping scales on their 
                shells that form a serrated-look on the edges. These colored and patterned shells make them
                 highly-valuable and commonly sold as "tortoiseshell" in markets.
                 Hawksbills are found mainly throughout the world's tropical oceans, predominantly in coral reefs.</p>

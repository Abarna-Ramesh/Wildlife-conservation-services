            <h2 class="category">Role in ecosystem:</h2>
            <p class="paragraph">Amur leopards are important ecologically. They are top predators, meaning they play an important role in maintaining a healthy balance of species in their habitat.
                This influences the condition of the forest and ecosystem, which supplies wildlife and people with food, freshwater and many other resources.

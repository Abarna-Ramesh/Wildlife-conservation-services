            <h2 class="category">Where it lives: </h2>
            <p class="paragraph">Orangutans are found only in the rain forests of the Southeast Asian islands of Borneo and Sumatra </p>

            <h2 class="category">It's natural habitat: </h2>
            <p class="paragraph">Bornean Orangutans' inhabit primary and secondary forest, typically in lowland dipterocarp, freshwater and peat swamp forests. </p>

            <h2 class="category">Role in ecosystem:</h2>
            <p class="paragraph">Orangutans help forest health by acting as the world's largest seed dispersers. They cover large areas as they forage for food, an additional risk in fragmented habitat. They spend most of their time in trees. That's where they thrive.</p>

            <h2 class="category">How can we help:</h2>
                <p class="paragraph">Support organizations such as Health In Harmony that are working to protect orangutans and their habitats. </p>
               <p class="paragraph"> Buy FSC-certified products.</p>
                <p class="paragraph">By purchasing certified sustainable palm oil and FSC-certified forest products, retailers and manufacturers help protect  habitat by limiting illegal logging and forest conversion. Consumers can help by demanding certified products.</p>
                <p class="paragraph">Avoid products made with unsustainable palm oil.</p>
